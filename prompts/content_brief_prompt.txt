The brief should include:

1. **Objective**: What the post aims to achieve
2. **Target Audience**: Who the post is for
3. **Key Messages**: 3-5 main points to convey
4. **Structure Outline**:
   - Introduction (hook and thesis)
   - Body sections (with headings and key points)
   - Conclusion (call to action or key takeaway)
5. **Tone and Style**: Professional, insightful, conversational
6. **Word Count**: Approximately 1000 words
7. **SEO Keywords**: Primary and secondary keywords
